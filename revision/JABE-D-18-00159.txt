Due to ongoing technical issues (unrelated to the journal&manuscript)
I haven't been able to thoroughly assess the detail of the content of
the paper, and can only give general comments:

- The paper is clear and well written

- Some previous and controversial work made the error of trying to
  minimise the number of proxies used for reconstruction, which had
  the effect of removing all the useful information.  From what I can
  tell, this paper avoids that trap, and instead formulates the
  dimension reduction as a computational cost issue.  With this in
  mind, it might be wise to be more clear about this; the goal isn't
  to find "the best" summary pseudo-proxy, but rather to actually
  reconstruct the temperature signal, which would ideally make use of
  _all_ the available data; the PCA dimension reduction should a means
  to that end, and not an end in itself.

- I really like that several assessment criteria are used; it's clear from
  the table that relying on only one would run the risk of overinterpreting
  the method differences.
