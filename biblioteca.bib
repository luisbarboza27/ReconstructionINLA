abstract = {During the last three decades, Bayesian methods have developed greatly in the field of epidemiology. Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint.Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method.In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been an alternative to ordinary least squares for handling multicollinearity in several areas of scientific research since the 1960s. It has recently gained much attention in the analysis of high dimensional genomic data. We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

abstract = {Among methods to analyze high-dimensional data, the sliced inverse regression (SIR) is of particular interest for non-linear relations between the dependent variable and some indices of the covariate. When the dimension of the covariate is greater than the number of observations, classical versions of SIR cannot be applied. Various upgrades were then proposed to tackle this issue such as regularized SIR (RSIR) and sparse ridge SIR (SR-SIR), to estimate the parameters of the underlying model and to select variables of interest. In this paper, we introduce two new estimation methods respectively based on the QZ algorithm and on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse.We also describe a new selection procedure of the most relevant components of the covariate that relies on a proximity criterion between submodels and the initial one. These approaches are compared with RSIR and SR-SIR in a simulation study. Finally we applied SIR-QZ and the associated selection procedure to a genetic dataset in order to find markers that are linked to the expression of a gene. These markers are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).},

Using between two (R2) and 28 (R28) proxy records we compare four 1000-member ensemble reconstructions of regional temperature using four statistical methods: Principal Component Regression (PCR), Composite Plus Scale (CPS), Bayesian Hierarchical Models (LNA) and Pairwise Comparison (PaiCo). The reconstructions are compared with a three-member ensemble of GISS-E2-R model simulations and independent palaeoclimate records.Decadal fluctuations in Australasian temperatures are remarkably similar between the four reconstruction methods. There are, however, differences in the amplitude of temperature variations between the different statistical methods and proxy networks.

Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25{\%} of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent verification. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2mair temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450‚Äì1800 C.E.). Verification against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880‚Äì2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas.

abstract = {Existing multi-proxy climate reconstruction methods assume the suitably transformed proxy time series are linearly related to the target climate variable, which is likely a simplifying assumption for many proxy records. Furthermore, with a single exception, these methods face problems with varying temporal resolutions of the proxy data. Here we introduce a new reconstruction method that uses the ordering of all pairs of proxy observations within each record to arrive at a consensus time series that best agrees with all proxy records. The resulting unitless composite time series is subsequently calibrated to the instrumental record to provide an estimate of past climate. By considering only pairwise comparisons, this method, which we call PaiCo, facilitates the inclusion of records with differing temporal resolutions, and relaxes the assumption of linearity to the more general assumption of a monotonically increasing relationship between each proxy series and the target climate variable. We apply PaiCo to a newly assembled collection of high-quality proxy data to reconstruct the mean temperature of the Northernmost Atlantic region, which we call Arctic Atlantic, over the last 2,000 years. The Arctic Atlantic is a dynamically important region known to feature substantial temperature variability over recent millennia, and PaiCo allows for a more thorough investigation of the Arctic Atlantic regional climate as we include a diverse array of terrestrial and marine proxies with annual to multidecadal temporal resolutions. Comparisons of the PaiCo reconstruction to recent reconstructions covering larger areas indicate greater climatic variability in the Arctic Atlantic than for the Arctic as a whole. The Arctic Atlantic reconstruction features temperatures during the Roman Warm Period and Medieval Climate Anomaly that are comparable or even warmer than those of the twentieth century, and coldest temperatures in the middle of the nineteenth century, just prior to the onset of the recent warming trend.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of climate change in its full richness
requires the knowledge of long temperature time series. Although
long-term, widely distributed temperature observations are not available,
there are other forms of data, known as climate proxies, that can
have a statistical relationship with temperatures and have been used
to infer temperatures in the past before direct measurements. We
propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct past temperatures
that integrates information from different sources, such as proxies
with different temporal resolution and forcings acting as the external
drivers of large scale temperature evolution. Additionally, this
method allows us to quantify the uncertainty of the reconstruction
in a rigorous manner. The reconstruction method is assessed, using
a global climate model as the true climate system and with synthetic
proxy data derived from the simulation. The target is to reconstruct
Northern Hemisphere temperature from proxies that mimic the sampling
and errors from tree ring measurements, pollen indices, and borehole
temperatures. The forcing series used as covariates are solar irradiance,
volcanic aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations. The Bayesian
model was successful in integrating these different sources of information
in creating a coherent reconstruction. Within the context of this
numerical testbed, a statistical process model that includes the
external forcings can improve the quality of a hemispheric reconstruction
when long time scale proxy information is not available. This article

They are based on a "slicing step" in the population and sample versions. They are sensitive to the choice of the number H of slices, and this is particularly true for SIR-II and SAVE methods. At the moment there are no theoretical results nor practical techniques which allows the user to choose an appropriate number of slices. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the quality of the estimation of the effective dimension reduction (EDR) space: the square trace correlation between the true EDR space and its estimate can be used as goodness of estimation. We introduce a na {\textless} ve bootstrap estimation of the square trace correlation criterion to allow selection of an "optimal" number of slices. Moreover, this criterion can also simultaneously select the corresponding suitable dimension K (number of the linear combination of X). From a practical point of view, the choice of these two parameters H and K is essential. We propose a 3D-graphical tool, implemented in R, which can be useful to select the suitable couple (H, K). An R package named "edrGraphicalTools" has been developed. In this article, we focus on the SIR-I, SIR-II and SAVE methods. Moreover the proposed criterion can be use to determine which method seems to be efficient to recover the EDR space, that is the structure between Y and X. We indicate how the proposed criterion can be used in practice. A simulation study is performed to illustrate the behavior of this approach and the need for selecting properly the number H of slices and the dimension K. A short real-data example is also provided.},

abstract = {Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are at unprecedented, record-high levels compared to pre-industrial reconstructions over the last 800,000 years. Those elevated greenhouse gas concentrations warm the planet and together with net cooling effects by aerosols, they are the reason of observed climate change over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of those concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent and future climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated data sets of historical atmospheric (volume) mixing ratios of 43 greenhouse gases specifically for the purpose of climate model runs. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks and a large set of literature studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved, and include seasonality over the period between year 0 to 2014. We assimilate data for CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), 5 chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 3 hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), 16 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 3 halons, methyl bromide (CH3Br), 3 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen triflouride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). We estimate 1850 annual and global mean surface mixing ratios of CO2 at 284.3 ppmv, CH4 at 808.2 ppbv and N2O at 273.0 ppbv and quantify the seasonal and hemispheric gradients of surface mixing ratios. Compared to earlier intercomparisons, the stronger implied radiative forcing in the northern hemisphere winter (due to the latitudinal gradient and seasonality) may help to improve the skill of climate models to reproduce past climate and thereby reduce uncertainty in future projections.},

This includes the addition of newly digitised measurement data, both over land and sea, new sea-surface temperature bias adjustments and a more comprehensive error model for describing uncertainties in sea-surface temperature measurements. An ensemble approach has been adopted to better describe complex temporal and spatial interdependencies of measurement and bias uncertainties and to allow these correlated uncertainties to be taken into account in studies that are based upon HadCRUT4. Climate diagnostics computed from the gridded data set broadly agree with those of other global near-surface temperature analyses.

In this paper, we propose a computational framework to perform approximate full Bayesian inference in linear and generalized dynamic linear models based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach. The proposed framework directly approximates the posterior marginals of interest disregarding the assumption of recursive updating/estimation of the states and hyperparameters in the case of fixed datasets and, therefore, enable us to do fully Bayesian analysis of complex state-space models more easily and in a short computational time. The proposed framework overcomes some limitations of current tools in the dynamic modeling literature and is vastly illustrated with a series of simulated as well as well known real-life examples from the literature, including realistically complex models with correlated error structures and models with more than one state vector, being mutually dependent on each other.

We model precipitation amounts by a generalized extreme value distribution which is left-censored at zero. This distribution permits modelling precipitation on the original scale without prior transformation of the data. A closed form expression for its continuous ranked probability score can be derived and permits computationally efficient model fitting. We discuss an extension of our approach which incorporates further statistics characterizing the spatial variability of precipitation amounts in the vicinity of the location of interest. The proposed EMOS method is applied to daily 18 h forecasts of 6 h accumulated precipitation over Germany in 2011 using the COSMO-DE ensemble prediction system operated by the German Meteorological Service. It yields calibrated and sharp predictive distributions and compares favourably with extended logistic regression and Bayesian model averaging which are state-of-the-art approaches for precipitation post-processing.

of temperature change has been attributed to the increased strength
of the circumpolar westerlies, largely in response to changes in
stratospheric ozone2. This picture, however, is substantially incomplete
owing to the sparseness and short duration of the observations. Here
we show that significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic
Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica, an area of warming much
larger than previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1¬†¬∞C
per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and
spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East
Antarctica, the continent-wide average near-surface temperature trend
is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model reproduce
the essential features of the spatial pattern and the long-term trend,
and we suggest that neither can be attributed directly to increases
in the strength of the westerlies. Instead, regional changes in atmospheric
circulation and associated changes in sea surface temperature and
sea ice are required to explain the enhanced warming in West Antarctica.},

joint data covariance matrix and a multivariate regression of the

assumptions made by BARCAST and RegEM are detailed, and the impacts
of these differences on the analysis are discussed. Key distinctions
between BARCAST and RegEM include their treatment of spatial and

analysis, the quantities they seek to impute, the end product of
each analysis, the temporal variance of the reconstructed field,
and the treatment of uncertainty in both the imputed values and functions

by applying the two approaches to various surrogate datasets. If
the assumptions inherent to BARCAST are not strongly violated, then
in scenarios comparable to practical applications BARCAST results
in reconstructions of both the field and the spatial mean that are
more skillful than those produced by RegEM, as measured by the coefficient

BARCAST are narrower than those estimated using RegEM and contain

algorithm, which is based on an empirical estimate of the joint data
covariance matrix and a multivariate regression of the instrumental
time series onto the proxy time series. The differing assumptions
made by BARCAST and RegEM are detailed, and the impacts of these
differences on the analysis are discussed. Key distinctions between
BARCAST and RegEM include their treatment of spatial and temporal
covariance, the prior information that enters into each analysis,
the quantities they seek to impute, the end product of each analysis,
the temporal variance of the reconstructed field, and the treatment
of uncertainty in both the imputed values and functions of these
imputations. Differences between BARCAST and RegEM are illustrated
by applying the two approaches to various surrogate datasets. If
the assumptions inherent to BARCAST are not strongly violated, then
in scenarios comparable to practical applications BARCAST results
in reconstructions of both the field and the spatial mean that are
more skillful than those produced by RegEM, as measured by the coefficient
of efficiency. In addition, the uncertainty intervals produced by
BARCAST are narrower than those estimated using RegEM and contain
the true values with higher probability.},

abstract = {The Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA) forcing generator produces stratospheric aerosol optical properties as a function of time, latitude, height and wavelength for a given input list of volcanic eruption attributes. EVA is based on a parameterized three-box model of stratospheric transport, and simple scaling relationships used to derive mid-visible (550 nm) aerosol optical depth and aerosol effective radius from stratospheric sulfate mass. Pre-calculated look up tables computed from Mie theory are used to produce wavelength dependent aerosol extinction, single scattering albedo and scattering asymmetry factor values. The structural form of EVA, and the tuning of its parameters, are chosen to produce best agreement with the satellite-based reconstruction of stratospheric aerosol properties following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, and with prior millennial-time scale forcing reconstructions including the 1815 eruption of Tambora. EVA can be used to produce volcanic forcing for climate models which is based on recent observations and physical understanding, but internally self-consistent over any time-scale of choice. In addition, EVA is constructed so as to allow for easy modification of different aspects of aerosol properties, in order to be used in model experiments to help advance understanding of what aspects of the volcanic aerosol are important for the climate system.},

abstract = {Aims. We present a physically consistent reconstruction of the total solar irradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate the evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the Holocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance are due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar surface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from decadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural archives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes from the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record in natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a linear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic flux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a di{\_}erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that major sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the uncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the uncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The analysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the last 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole moment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based on the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based reconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be of interest for studies of climate change over the last 11500 years. The reconstruction indicates that the decadally averaged total solar irradiance ranges over approximately 1.5 W/m2 from grand maxima to grand minima.},
